These scripts were used to migration from Exchange 2010 to Office 365.  They should be adaptable for any version of Exchange On-Prem.

If they aren't already, I will be commenting them with more detail - and polishing up some of the code as needed.

Feel free to take them as-is, and build off them.  These have had all proprietary company information removed.

NOTE: These have not been tested since removing the proprietary information.
